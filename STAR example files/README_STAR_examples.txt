Example files generated from running "STAR_Methods_Tissue_Cartography_Modeling.m" as described in "Protocol for 3D surface texture modeling and quantitative spectral decomposition analysis in Drosophila border cell clusters" by Gabbert, et. al STAR Protocols 2024.
These files are generated from the step "Extract the surface of the cluster using ImSAnE". 
Step 15 compresses the original TIF file into an h5 file, as shown in "STAR_Example_h5".
Step 17 exports a prediction from Ilastik, as shown in "STAR_Example_Probabilities".
Step 18 converts the probabilities into an OBJ file, as shown in "STAR_Example_OBJ".
